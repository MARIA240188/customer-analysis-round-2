For this lab, we will be using the marketing_customer_analysis.csv file that you can find in the files_for_lab folder. Check out the files_for_lab/about.md to get more information if you are using the Online Excel.

Note: For the next labs we will be using the same data file. Please save the code, so that you can re-use it later in the labs following this lab.

Dealing with the data
Show the dataframe shape.
Standardize header names.
Which columns are numerical?
Which columns are categorical?
Check and deal with NaN values.
Datetime format - Extract the months from the dataset and store in a separate column. Then filter the data to show only the information for the first quarter , ie. January, February and March. Hint: If data from March does not exist, consider only January and February.
BONUS: Put all the previously mentioned data transformations into a function.
